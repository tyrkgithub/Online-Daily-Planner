# <h1>Week Seven Challenge - Work Day Scheduler</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>This weeks challenge is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code</p>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.
<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To meet the clients requirements I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner</li>
  <li>Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down</li>
  <li>Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed</li>
  <li>Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock</li>
  <li>Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock</li>
  <li>Persist events between refreshes of a page</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I have found my one-on-one tutoring session to be highly resourceful. Things we discussed included: parent and siblings as well as setting and getting local storage. Another resource I have used is w3schools where I was able to practice getHours. I also read an article on moment.js from everydat.codes.<br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>I will need to spend more time to complete this project</li>
   <li>I need to have the past/present/future classes display at the right times, display the times along the side and insert the button image</li>
   <li>I was struggling to add class correctly before my one-on-one. Then I found out some jquery and javascript wont mix correctly</li>
