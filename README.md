# <h1>Week Seven Challenge - Work Day Scheduler</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>This weeks challenge is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code</p>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.
<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To meet the clients requirements I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
   The app should:


Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.


Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.


Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.


Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock


Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.


Persist events between refreshes of a page
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I have found my one-on-one tutoring session to be highly resourceful. Things we discussed included: prompt, confirm, aler and isNaN. Another resource I have used is w3schools. This website explains how to use Javascript, give examples and has exercises for you to complete.<br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>After learning about the spread syntax I was able to reduce the amount of code</li>
   <li>In my one-to-one the tutor installed the Prettier extention on VS Code which helps your code to look better formated</li>
